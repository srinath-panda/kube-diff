on the day of switch
1. make mirror 
 - we set all replicas to 0
 - pause all SO 


2. kd --deploy --cron  
   -- update the uimage tag and config for all workers and non workers but wont scale for anything
expection:
   -- update image/tag for all except workers managed in pd-app-charts but wont scale for anything


3. kd --mirror  
  -- scale up replica for non workers
  -- update the image tag and config 
  -- unpause scaledobject for non workers 
expection:
  -- update image/tag for all except workers managed in pd-app-charts
  -- scale up replica for non workers
  -- unpause scaledobject for non workers 


while switch 
3. kd --savestate 
- saves the state of the src cluster

4. kd --enableworkers , expects the --savestate to be run
- scale up the workers in new cluster
- set the replica to 0 for  all workers in  old and set the correct replica in the new cluster based on the saved state
- set the image as change-me to only for workers managed in pd-app-charts in src cluster
- unpause all the SO for all workers 



the below is not used anymore 
4. enable-workers.sh (implement in this kd code) 
    - upscale the replica for all workers in new 
    - downscale the replica for all workers in old
    - unpasue scaledobject for all workers in new 
expection:
  - update image/tag for all  services/worker managed in pd-app-charts & pd-devops
  - scale up replica for all workers in new cluster and downscale in old cluster + set the image to 'change-me' in old cluster 
  
   ( qn:- do we need to put the image to changeme and dont downscale it ??? )
  - unpause the scaledobjects for all works
